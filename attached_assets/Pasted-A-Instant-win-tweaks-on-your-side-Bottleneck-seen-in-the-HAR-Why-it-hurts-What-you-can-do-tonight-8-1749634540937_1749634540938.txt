A. Instant win tweaks on your side
Bottleneck seen in the HAR	Why it hurts	What you can do tonight
876 ms TTFB for the HTML – the express dev server (Vite “preview” / vite --dev) is running in Replit’s sandbox pod.	Sandboxes wake from sleep, cold-start the interpreter, and sit behind a high-latency proxy.	Deploy a production build instead of serving from dev:
bash\nnpm run build # creates /dist\ndeploy --prod # Replit Deployments tab → “Static / Edge”\n
This ships pre-rendered assets on Replit’s global edge CDN—TTFB usually drops to <120 ms worldwide.
>1 MB of unminified JS (@vite/client, React refresh chunks).	Vite’s hot-reload bundle, source-maps & dev helpers go to the browser.	After npm run build, serve only the tree-shaken, hashed chunks in /dist → 30–70 kB gzip instead of 1 MB.
Google Fonts request (50 ms DNS + 30 ms connect + 12 ms wait)	Extra round-trip & blocked render on first paint.	1. Download the Inter & Orbitron woff2 files and host them from /public/fonts.
2. Replace the external stylesheet with local @font-face rules.
TLS handshake (≈ 145 ms) for every request to the Replit proxy.	Each new connection hits the same London POP even for nearby visitors.	Make all asset URLs HTTP/2 push-friendly: keep them on the same origin so they reuse the initial TLS connection.
Large CSS (129 kB) blocking render.	User stares at a white screen while CSS downloads.	Critical-CSS split: inline the first 4 kB (font-face, layout above-the-fold) into <style> and defer the rest with media="print" onload="this.media='all'".
Favicon + JS + CSS all Cache-Control: no-cache	Forces re-download every visit.	In your Express or Replit static config:
js\napp.use(express.static('dist', { maxAge: '30d' }));\n

B. Message template for Replit Support
Subject: Please move my repl to Replit Deployments / Edge static hosting for lower TTFB & enable Brotli
Project URL: https://dunk-calculator.info/ (current sandbox: d1be26cf-e198-4efe-ad2c-aa3211855fb7-00-1nl6tafembsqk.pike.replit.dev)

Hi Replit Team,

My site is performance-sensitive (Pingdom shows ~900 ms TTFB). Could you help with the following?

Deployments edge hosting
 • Promote the repl to a Static Edge Deployment so HTML & assets sit on your CDN, not the sandbox proxy.

Enable Brotli & cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable for .js, .css, .woff2, .webp.

HTTP/2 ALPN + Early Hints if available—especially for /dist/assets/*.js and /public/fonts/*.woff2.

Compression for streamed HTML – gzip/Brotli on text/html responses from the origin function.

Raise the memory limit to 1024 MB during build so npm run build can tree-shake React without OOM.

Thanks a ton!
– Your Name

(That wording matches what Replit engineers expect and hits every lever they can actually pull.)

If you want sub-100 ms worldwide with zero DevOps
Vercel / Netlify – drop the dist/ folder there; they auto-optimize, add immutable caching and Brotli.

Point dunk-calculator.info via CNAME, keep Replit only for the Node API/calculator endpoint if needed.
