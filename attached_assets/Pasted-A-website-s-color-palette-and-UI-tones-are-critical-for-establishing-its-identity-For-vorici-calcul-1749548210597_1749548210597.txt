A website's color palette and UI tones are critical for establishing its identity. For vorici-calculator.info, the goal is to create a look and feel that is immediately recognizable and trustworthy to Path of Exile players.

The design must feel like an authentic extension of the game itself—dark, gritty, and functional, with key highlights that draw from the game's iconic currency and themes.

Here is a full breakdown of the recommended color tone and UI colors.
Core Design Philosophy: "Authentic Wraeclast"

The aesthetic should be dark, gothic, and professional. It's a tool, so clarity is paramount, but the theme must be respected. We will avoid bright, clean, corporate designs. The primary inspiration is the in-game UI of Path of Exile.
Recommended Color Palette: "Classic Wraeclast Gold"

This is the safest, most authentic, and highly recommended palette. It mirrors the game's dark stone backgrounds and uses the iconic gold/yellow of high-tier currency as its primary accent.
Palette Breakdown:
Role	Color	Hex Code	Rationale & Use-Case
Primary Background	Charcoal Stone	#121212	A very dark gray, not pure black. It's easy on the eyes for long sessions. This is the main background for the entire site.
UI Panel / Container	Dark Slate	#1E1E1E	A slightly lighter gray used for containers like the main calculator box, guide cards, and blog post backgrounds. This creates a subtle sense of depth.
Primary Accent	Exalted Gold	#C8B379	A muted, classy gold, reminiscent of Exalted/Divine Orbs. This is for all interactive elements: buttons, active tabs, links, and selected states.
Success/Highlight	Vibrant Gold	#FFD700	A brighter gold used for hover effects on buttons and links, or for highlighting important results from a calculation.
Text (Headings)	Off-White	#F5F5F5	A very light gray for all headings (H1, H2, etc.). Bright and readable without the harshness of pure white.
Text (Body)	Light Slate	#BDBDBD	A softer light gray for all paragraph text. This creates a clear visual hierarchy between headings and body copy.
Attribute Red (STR)	Strength Red	#D42B2B	For Strength-related icons and selections within the calculator.
Attribute Green (DEX)	Dexterity Green	#4CAF50	For Dexterity-related icons and selections.
Attribute Blue (INT)	Intelligence Blue	#2196F3	For Intelligence-related icons and selections.
Visual Application of the Color Palette

Here’s how to apply these colors throughout the UI for a cohesive experience:

1. General Site Layout:

    The <body> background will be Charcoal Stone (#121212). For a more advanced look, you can add a very subtle, low-opacity repeating background texture that looks like dark granite or cracked stone.
    The main content area or any container boxes will use Dark Slate (#1E1E1E) with a faint 1px border of an even lighter gray to make them pop slightly.

2. The All-in-One Calculator UI:

    The calculator's main container will be Dark Slate (#1E1E1E).
    Tabs ([Chromatic] [Sockets] [Links]):
        Inactive tabs have Light Slate (#BDBDBD) text.
        The active tab has Exalted Gold (#C8B379) text with a gold underline.
    Buttons ([Cost Breakdown], [Reset]):
        Background: Exalted Gold (#C8B379).
        Text: Charcoal Stone (#121212).
        On Hover: The background brightens to Vibrant Gold (#FFD700).
    Input Fields:
        Background: A darker version of the panel, e.g., #1A1A1A.
        Border: A 1px solid border of Light Slate (#BDBDBD).
        On Focus: The border glows with Exalted Gold (#C8B379).
    Socket SVGs:
        The clickable socket circles will have a Light Slate border.
        When a user clicks to select a color, the SVG's fill should change to the corresponding Attribute Red/Green/Blue.

3. Typography & Links:

    All <h1>, <h2>, etc., headings will use the Off-White (#F5F5F5) color.
    All paragraph text (<p>) will use the Light Slate (#BDBDBD) color for easy readability.
    All hyperlinks (<a>) will be the Exalted Gold (#C8B379) color and will not be underlined by default.
    On link hover, the color should brighten to Vibrant Gold (#FFD700) and gain an underline to provide clear visual feedback.

4. Fonts (Crucial for Theme):

    Headings Font: "Cinzel" (available free on Google Fonts). This font is very similar to the "Trajan Pro" font used in Path of Exile's logo and in-game text, giving it an instantly authentic feel.
    Body Font: "Lato" or "Roboto" (available free on Google Fonts). Use a clean, highly readable sans-serif font for all paragraph text. The contrast between a serif heading and a sans-serif body is a classic, professional design choice.

Alternative Palettes (If you want a different style)
Alternative 1: "Corrupted Vaal"

For a more aggressive, blood-magic theme.

    Primary Accent: Blood Red (#A62B2B).
    Secondary Accent: Muted Gold (#A8915A).
    Everything else: Remains the same as the "Classic" palette.

Alternative 2: "Betrayal Syndicate"

For a cleaner, more modern dark-mode feel.

    Primary Accent: Bright Cyan (#00BCD4).
    Secondary Accent: Lime Green (#AEEA00) (for success states).
    Backgrounds: Can have a slight blue tint (#1A202C).
    Everything else: Remains the same.

Final Recommendation: Stick with the "Classic Wraeclast Gold" palette. It is timeless, authentic, and perfectly aligned with the expectations of the Path of Exile community. It will make your tool feel like a professional and integral part of the PoE ecosystem.
