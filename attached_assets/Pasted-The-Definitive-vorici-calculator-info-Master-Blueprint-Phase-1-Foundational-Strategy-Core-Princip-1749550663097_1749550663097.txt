The Definitive vorici-calculator.info Master Blueprint
Phase 1: Foundational Strategy & Core Principles

Step 1: The Mission

    Goal: To become the #1 trusted, go-to destination for Path of Exile players to calculate, understand, and master crafting mechanics related to sockets, links, and colors.
    Unique Selling Proposition (USP): We provide the most accurate, fastest, and fully integrated All-in-One crafting tool (Chromatic, Jeweller's, Fusing), kept meticulously up-to-date for every PoE league, and supported by the most comprehensive guides available.

Step 2: The Architecture: The Definitive Sitemap
This is the final, non-negotiable site structure. It uses an SEO Silo model to maximize topical authority.

Note: There are NO separate pages like /calculator or /chromatic-orb-calculator. All tool functionality lives on the homepage.
Phase 2: The All-in-One Calculator - UI/UX & Interactive Design

The tool on the homepage is the heart of the site. Its design must be flawless.

1. Layout & Interface:

    A single, clean component placed "above the fold" on the homepage.
    Tabbed Interface: The component will have three clean, clickable tabs at the top:
        [Chromatic Orbs] (for socket colors)
        [Jeweller's Orbs] (for number of sockets)
        [Orbs of Fusing] (for socket links)
    The active tab will be visually distinct (e.g., brighter, underlined).

2. Interactive Elements & SVGs:

    Inputs: Use a mix of dropdown menus and text fields.
        Item Base: Dropdown with icons. Use clean, high-quality SVGs for Strength (red fist icon), Dexterity (green bow icon), and Intelligence (blue staff icon).
        Item Level: Number input.
        Number of Sockets/Links: Stepper input (- and + buttons).
        Desired Colors: A series of six circles representing sockets. Clicking a circle cycles through Red, Green, Blue, White, or Disabled. The SVG for the socket should dynamically change color on click.
    Real-Time Results: There is NO "Submit" button. All result fields update instantly via JavaScript as the user changes any input.
    Outputs:
        Clearly display "Average Cost," "Probability of Success," and "Recommended Method" (e.g., "Vorici Bench: 2 Red" vs. "Spam Chromatics").
        Use SVGs of the Chromatic, Jeweller's, and Fusing orbs next to the cost outputs.
    Utility Buttons:
        [Cost Breakdown]: A small button that, on click, opens a modal (popup) showing the exact mathematical formula and probabilities used for the calculation. This builds immense trust.
        [Copy Results]: A button to copy the results to the clipboard as plain text for easy sharing.
        [Reset]: A button to clear all inputs for the current tab.

3. Session Tracker (Advanced Feature):

    A small, persistent box in the corner of the tool that tracks the "Total Orbs Spent" during the user's session. Every time they get a result, they can click an "Add to Session" button, and it updates the tracker. This is incredibly useful for long crafting sessions.
